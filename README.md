I'm more concentrated on the engineering side of things. I love reading papers, and I try publishing occasionally, but I'd much rather use my knowledge of Web to deploy something which has applied significance in real time. Yes, you got me, I love design and am a self proclaimed minimalist. See ya ;) ❤️
